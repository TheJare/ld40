# Idle Icon

A Ludum Dare 40 entry by Javier Arevalo.

The theme is "the more you have, the worse it is". I only had a couple hours to do something, so I decided
to go for a 10000000-inspired idle runner HTML5 game, where the enemy shows a weakness icon and you can use the equivalent item from your inventory to hit harder. Eventually you will have too many items and it will be pretty hard to figure out what to click.

There is no death; I was going to explore that but it would take too much testing for my limited time.

The graphics are... limited to say the least. I generate a bunch of icon graphics which I then convert to HTML images via their Data URLs. The rest is colored rectangles to represent several layers of scenery props, the player and the enemy.
